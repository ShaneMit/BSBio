For this project we were tasked with creating a portfolio website using Bootstrap styling. I started with the About Me section and added a carousel with photos that I took to scroll across the top. Along with a brief description of myself, I added a photo of myself . This is also where I created the Navbar and Footer sections that I later copied to the other pages. After creating the HTML files for the other two pages, I made all the links in the Navbar work and made sure the proper page link showed active when you were on that page. Next I created the contact page from three forms from bootstrap and customized them to prompt for the info I wanted. I then added a Submit button. After that I moved on to the portfolio which includes a brief description of four projects that I worked on for class as well as a screenshot of each. Overall this project took a large amount of figuring out but was really enjoyable once I started to get the hang of it.
